# Flanker UI

Flanker UI is a lightweight, reactive UI framework for building dynamic web applications with TypeScript. It provides a simple yet powerful set of tools for state management, DOM manipulation, and component-based rendering.

## Features

- **Reactive Views**: Auto-updating components via `mountView`.
- **State**: Shared reactive state with `createStore`.
- **Fluent DOM**: Cleaner manipulation via extended `HTMLElement` helpers.
- **VQL**: Native VQL queries for data.
- **Events**: Declarative event delegation for dynamic content.
- **Modular**: Use DOM extensions or other parts standalone.
